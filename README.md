# Lansweeper.Smb
SMB library based on [TalAloni's SMBLibrary](https://github.com/TalAloni/SMBLibrary).

This fork is probably not useful since this implementation can only `Connect` and `Login`, but can't do any actual file transfers.
Feel free to use any code as long as the license is respected.

## Changes
- Modernized C#
- Threw out all the stuff we don't need
- Added many tests
- Bug fixes
- Improved performance (although there is still to be gained)
